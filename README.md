# orphan-scripts
This is where lonely one of use scripts go that don't have a family or a home of any kind. These poor sad scripts may have just been to demo an approach, test practicality, experiments generated by AI, or just for fun. These scrips do not hold value and are not finished. Do not use any code in this repo for anything other than fun and intrigue.
